* list element with functor item
{:toc}
<hr />



## 點選按鈕，放大文字


<p>點選按鈕時，&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt;內的文字大小設為25px</p>
<img src="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.01.44.71.jpg" alt="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.01.44.71.jpg"/>




<p>運行結果，文字大小為25px的畫面</p>
<img src="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.01.49.71.jpg" alt="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.01.49.71.jpg"/>




<p>統一變數為box，以減少jquery的dom搜尋次數</p>
<img src="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.02.56.29.jpg" alt="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.02.56.29.jpg"/>




<p>運行結果，修改後，設文字大小的功仍然正常運作</p>
<img src="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.02.58.71.jpg" alt="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.02.58.71.jpg"/>



## 轉換fontSize為數值型態，達成遞增字體大小的效果


<p>整理為閉包，且用console.log(fontSize)來測試預設字體的大小</p>
<img src="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.03.45.71.jpg" alt="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.03.45.71.jpg"/>




<p>運行結果，console中檢測，預設font-size大小為16px</p>
<img src="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.03.49.88.jpg" alt="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.03.49.88.jpg"/>




<p>檢測fontSize(字型大小)的變數型態</p>
<img src="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.03.56.29.jpg" alt="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.03.56.29.jpg"/>




<p>運行結果，fontSize型態為字串，字串是不能做數字運算的，所以要轉換為數字型態</p>
<img src="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.03.57.50.jpg" alt="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.03.57.50.jpg"/>




<p>使用parseInt()來轉換為數字後，測試是否能做數字運數(fontSize+5)</p>
<img src="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.04.46.71.jpg" alt="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.04.46.71.jpg"/>




<p>運行結果，數字由原先的16，經數字運算後變為21了</p>
<img src="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.04.52.46.jpg" alt="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.04.52.46.jpg"/>




<p>這次寫成fontSize+=5，使文字每點選一次變遞增5</p>
<img src="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.05.09.54.jpg" alt="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.05.09.54.jpg"/>




<p>運行結果，每按一次按鈕便可遞增字型大小</p>
<img src="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.05.31.00.jpg" alt="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.05.31.00.jpg"/>




<p>改為較短的寫法，寫成+=5就好</p>
<img src="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.05.47.62.jpg" alt="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.05.47.62.jpg"/>




<p>運行結果，較短的寫法仍可成功遞增字體大小</p>
<img src="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.05.51.21.jpg" alt="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.05.51.21.jpg"/>



## css同時改變font-size和color


<p>也可同時修改多個css，如改成遞減字型大小，並將字設為白色。但若每修改一個樣式，就寫一個.css()太麻煩了。</p>
<img src="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.06.28.21.jpg" alt="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.06.28.21.jpg"/>




<p>有多個css樣式要設定時，可用將樣式寫在該{}內，統一為一個物件，以便一同修改css樣式</p>
<img src="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.06.57.38.jpg" alt="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.06.57.38.jpg"/>




<p>運行結果，成功運行，字大小和字顏色一同被改變了</p>
<img src="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.06.58.33.jpg" alt="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.06.58.33.jpg"/>



## animate()改變fontSize和width


<p>將box.css改為box.animate就是動畫效果的設定了</p>
<img src="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.07.09.71.jpg" alt="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.07.09.71.jpg"/>




<p>運行結果，定型遞增動畫成功運行，不過字的顏色沒變，因animate()不支援改字顏色</p>
<img src="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.07.15.33.jpg" alt="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.07.15.33.jpg"/>




<p>同時遞加字型大小、寬度(注意，不用寫px喔)</p>
<img src="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.08.05.71.jpg" alt="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.08.05.71.jpg"/>




<p>運行結果，字型大小和寬度同步遞增</p>
<img src="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.08.14.38.jpg" alt="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.08.14.38.jpg"/>




<p>檢測原始碼，可看到animate()是快速修改style屬性，以得到動畫的效果</p>
<img src="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.08.39.38.jpg" alt="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.08.39.38.jpg"/>




<p>讓動畫在3秒內跑完</p>
<img src="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.08.57.21.jpg" alt="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.08.57.21.jpg"/>




<p>運行結果，動畫在3秒內變化完成</p>
<img src="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.09.08.38.jpg" alt="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.09.08.38.jpg"/>



## animate()執行完第一次特效後，接續其它動作


<p>執行完swing特效後，執行console.log(&#x27;completed&#x27;)</p>
<img src="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.10.19.75.jpg" alt="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.10.19.75.jpg"/>




<p>運行結果，成功在執行完特效後，並console出complete</p>
<img src="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.10.23.46.jpg" alt="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.10.23.46.jpg"/>




<p>運用animate()的complete和step的方法，來分別記錄完成時和運作時的訊息</p>
<img src="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.11.08.75.jpg" alt="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.11.08.75.jpg"/>




<p>運行結果，成功console出動畫進行時和完成時的記錄</p>
<img src="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.11.11.96.jpg" alt="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.11.11.96.jpg"/>




<p>運用step()來觀察fontSize遞增的變化</p>
<img src="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.11.49.12.jpg" alt="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.11.49.12.jpg"/>




<p>運行結果，成功console出遞增的字型大小</p>
<img src="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.11.55.08.jpg" alt="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.11.55.08.jpg"/>




<p>在5秒內遞增字型大小為5後，接下來的5秒，改為遞增為10</p>
<img src="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.12.22.71.jpg" alt="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.12.22.71.jpg"/>




<p>運行結果，成功運行二次字型遞增動畫</p>
<img src="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.12.26.08.jpg" alt="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.12.26.08.jpg"/>




<p>在5秒內遞增字型大小為5後，接下來的3秒(3000)，上邊距移動500px</p>
<img src="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.13.08.58.jpg" alt="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.13.08.58.jpg"/>




<p>運行結果，成功運行，字體變大後，上邊距變為500px的效果(記得box的css要設為relative，否則top無法運作)</p>
<img src="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.13.11.71.jpg" alt="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.13.11.71.jpg"/>



## animate()的queue參數，如何影響動畫撥放時間


<p>queue設為false時，2個動畫加起來的時間為3000(第一個500，第2個2500)</p>
<img src="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.13.50.71.jpg" alt="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.13.50.71.jpg"/>




<p>queue設為true時，2個動畫加起來的時間為3500(第一個500，第2個3000)</p>
<img src="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.14.10.79.jpg" alt="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.14.10.79.jpg"/>



## css置中功能


<p>接下來的目地是，算出視窗的寬度後，以完成置中</p>
<img src="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.15.47.21.jpg" alt="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.15.47.21.jpg"/>




<p>運行結果，box的左上角的確是置中了，但我們是希望以box的中心置中</p>
<img src="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.15.53.62.jpg" alt="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.15.53.62.jpg"/>




<p>用視窗寬度的一半減去box寬度的一半，來算出置中位置</p>
<img src="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.16.07.71.jpg" alt="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.16.07.71.jpg"/>




<p>運行結果，減去box寬度的一半後，很接近置中了，但還有padding要處理</p>
<img src="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.16.11.17.jpg" alt="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.16.11.17.jpg"/>




<p>outerWidth()等於width+padding的長度</p>
<img src="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.16.49.75.jpg" alt="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.16.49.75.jpg"/>




<p>運行結果，很接近置中了，但還有預設的margin要處理</p>
<img src="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.17.00.00.jpg" alt="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.17.00.00.jpg"/>




<p>設定body{ margin:0;}</p>
<img src="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.17.18.62.jpg" alt="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.17.18.62.jpg"/>




<p>運行結果，置中成功了</p>
<img src="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.17.20.75.jpg" alt="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.17.20.75.jpg"/>




<p>如果margin不想設為0，那要如何置中呢?</p>
<img src="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.17.23.75.jpg" alt="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.17.23.75.jpg"/>




<p>這次box的位置設定，改為absolute</p>
<img src="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.17.31.71.jpg" alt="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.17.31.71.jpg"/>




<p>運行結果，但這樣按鈕會被box蓋住，按不到喔</p>
<img src="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.17.41.83.jpg" alt="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.17.41.83.jpg"/>




<p>直接設為absoulte是行不通的，所以先改回來為relative</p>
<img src="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.17.44.71.jpg" alt="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.17.44.71.jpg"/>




<p>改為按鈕點選後，才將box的位置排列設為absolute</p>
<img src="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.17.53.71.jpg" alt="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.17.53.71.jpg"/>




<p>運行結果，置中成功了</p>
<img src="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.17.58.71.jpg" alt="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.17.58.71.jpg"/>



## animate()置中功能


<p>之所以堅持要改為absolute的排列方式，是因為animate()一定要將位置排列設為absolute才可正常運作，不然這種置中的問題，只是修正margin為0就可以了</p>
<img src="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.18.20.21.jpg" alt="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.18.20.21.jpg"/>




<p>運行結果，置中動畫成功</p>

<p>使用兩次animate()來達成，先水平移動，後垂置移動的置中效果</p>
<img src="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.19.14.71.jpg" alt="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.19.14.71.jpg"/>




<p>運行結果，成功運行先水平，後垂直置中的動畫</p>
<img src="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.19.19.75.jpg" alt="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.19.19.75.jpg"/>




<p>這次設定動畫的撥放時間為2秒(2000)</p>
<img src="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.19.34.54.jpg" alt="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.19.34.54.jpg"/>




<p>運行結果，成功運行2秒內運行先水平後垂直的動畫</p>
<img src="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.19.38.46.jpg" alt="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.19.38.46.jpg"/>



## 圓角效果


<p>置中動畫完成了，現在來設定圓角效果(borderRadius)</p>
<img src="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.20.13.04.jpg" alt="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.20.13.04.jpg"/>




<p>運行結果，成功運行圓角化動畫(可以考慮用css寫就好)</p>
<img src="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.20.14.79.jpg" alt="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.20.14.79.jpg"/>




<p>這次改用css的寫法來設圓角</p>
<img src="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.20.23.71.jpg" alt="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.20.23.71.jpg"/>




<p>運用addClass()來加入剛寫好的圓角樣式</p>
<img src="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.20.28.71.jpg" alt="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.20.28.71.jpg"/>




<p>運行結果，圓角效果成功了(不過還沒有動畫喔)</p>
<img src="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.20.31.71.jpg" alt="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.20.31.71.jpg"/>




<p>寫入-webkit-transition: border-radius 1;(1秒內執行完圓角動畫效果)</p>
<img src="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.20.44.21.jpg" alt="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.20.44.21.jpg"/>




<p>運行結果，成功出現圓角動畫了(但是不同瀏灠器有不一樣的動畫寫法)</p>
<img src="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.20.50.08.jpg" alt="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.20.50.08.jpg"/>




<p>分別為-webkit(google chrome用)、-moz(firefox用)、-o(opera用)、-ms(IE用)</p>
<img src="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.21.08.71.jpg" alt="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.21.08.71.jpg"/>




<p>運行結果，不同瀏灠器都可正常運行動畫了</p>
<img src="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.21.23.67.jpg" alt="/images/coding-note/javascript/jQuery-30day/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method/12.Full-Control-With-The-Animate-Method-0.21.23.67.jpg"/>
